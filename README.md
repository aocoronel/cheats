# Cheatsheets

This repository contains helpful cheatsheets for [navi](https://github.com/denisidoro/navi) for both CLI usage and programming snippets.

## Conventions

1. All cheatsheets should be named accordingly to the tags it contains.
2. Use completing features when possible without extensive complexity.
3. Each file should contain only cheatsheets accordingly based on the tags. Grouping different commands or functions together is not allowed.
4. Each file should contain at most four tags

- The first tag tells it's use case (cli, snippet).
- The second tag tells what does it contains. For example, the command name (cryptsetup, ls, grep), or a function (basename, stat, malloc).
- The third tag is it's category. For example, if ffmpeg is featured, so a category could be media.
- The fourth tag may be used to further improve the meaning, like the programming language name. For example: `snippet-malloc-memory-c`.
